<b>Objective:</b> Predict whether passengers of the Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension during a spacetime anomaly collision.

<b>Dataset Overview</b>

The dataset consists of personal records of passengers, including features like PassengerId, HomePlanet, CryoSleep, Cabin, and the target variable Transported.

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<h4>Data Exploration and Preprocessing:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Initial Data Examination: The dataset contains 8693 entries with features related to passenger identity, travel details, and expenditures.</br></li>
<li>Handling Missing Values: Missing data in columns like HomePlanet, CryoSleep, and Age were imputed using the most frequent value for categorical and median for numerical features.</br></li>
<li>Data Type Conversion: Converted boolean columns such as CryoSleep and VIP to numerical format for analysis.</br></li>
</ul>
    
<h4>Feature Engineering:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cabin Splitting: The Cabin attribute was split into Deck, Num, and Side.</br></li>
<li>Total Expenditure: A new feature summing up all individual expenditures.</br></li>
<li>Group Size: Derived from PassengerId to represent the size of the group each passenger is traveling with.</br></li>
<li>Age Categories: Bucketed Age into categories like 'Child', 'Adult', and 'Senior'.</br></li>
<li>One-Hot Encoding: Applied to categorical variables like HomePlanet and Destination.</br></li>
</ul>

<h4>Model Selection:</h4>
<ul><li>Chose the Random Forest Classifier for its effectiveness in handling non-linear data and complex relationships between features.</li></ul>
    

<h4>Model Training and Validation:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Data Split: The dataset was split into training and validation sets.</br></li>
<li>Initial Training: The model was first trained with default hyperparameters.</br></li>
<li>Hyperparameter Tuning: Tuned parameters such as n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf.</br></li>
<li>Validation Metrics: Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</br></li>
</ul>


<h2>Results</h2>

<h4>Model Performance:</h4>
Both the initial and tuned Random Forest Classifiers, despite different hyperparameter settings, yielded an identical accuracy of 79.24% on the test dataset. This intriguing outcome suggests a few key points:
<ul>
<li>Stable Model Performance: The Random Forest model demonstrates stable performance, indicating its robustness in handling the dataset's features and complexities.</li>
<li>Optimal Default Parameters: The default parameters of the Random Forest may already be near-optimal for this particular dataset, as the hyperparameter tuning did not further enhance the accuracy.</li>
<li>Consistency Across Datasets: The model shows consistent performance across both the validation and test datasets, reinforcing its generalization capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<h4>Insights:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The choice of the Random Forest Classifier was effective for this binary classification problem. Its ability to handle the dataset with minimal tuning highlights the strength of the model in dealing with various feature types and relationships.</li>
<li>The lack of improvement with hyperparameter tuning might indicate that the chosen range and values of the parameters were not significantly different from the default settings, or that other aspects of the model and data processing pipeline play a more pivotal role in performance enhancement.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Further Exploration:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Broader Hyperparameter Tuning: Exploring a wider range of hyperparameters or employing more advanced tuning methods could potentially unlock improvements.</li>
<li>Alternative Modeling Approaches: Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms or ensemble methods might yield better or more insightful results.</li>
<li>Deep Dive into Feature Engineering: Further analysis and transformation of features, especially considering interactions and non-linear relationships, could prove beneficial.</li>
<li>Cross-Validation Strategy: Implementing a more robust cross-validation strategy could provide a more nuanced understanding of the model's performance and stability.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reflections:</h4>
<ul>
<li>This project underscores the importance of thorough experimentation and analysis in machine learning. While the model performed well, the journey highlighted the need for careful consideration of each step in the data science pipeline, from preprocessing to model selection and tuning.</li>
</ul>
